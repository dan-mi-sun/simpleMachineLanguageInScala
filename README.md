##Software Design and Programming 2015
###Assignment One — Simple Machine Language (SML)

####Objectives
The goal of this assignment is to give you practice with subclasses, modifying existing code, and the use of reflection.

####TODO:
Develop tests using scalatest:
http://www.scalatest.org/

Still need to debug bnz and look into following advice:
"So m.execute(0) starts execution of the machine with the pc set to zero.

m.execute(10) starts execution of the machine with the pc set to zero. Provided that you can find the location of the label, and hence the pc value…."

Total time spent on coursework 8 hours so far (first time using Scala for an independent project - so there has been some acclimatisation)
